  <h1><i>The XawPlus 3.1.0 Documentation</i></h1>

  <p>This set of documents describes the features and usage of
  XawPlus. This is no introduction in how to develop applications
  for X11 using XawPlus in general. It is meant for programmers,
  who are familiar in programming with the original Xaw or Motif
  library. The main idea is to describe all features and the
  deviations to the original Xaw library, because there are no new
  features without deviations to the original ;-)</p>

  <p>This documentation based completely on documents that comes
  with the X distribution. The description of the widgets based on
  the manual set and the rest is partial borrowed from a postscript
  document, found in the document path of the <i>xc</i>
  archives.</p>

  <h2>1. What is XawPlus and what is new ?</h2>

  <p>XawPlus 3.1.0 is a clone of the original Xaw library,
  providing a more up to date look to the original Athena widget
  set. This library is as compatible as possible to the original in
  its X11R6.6 version. It should be possible to compile the source
  code of any Xaw client without any changes (except the include
  path of the XawPlus header files) to get the new look of XawPlus
  to this client. A lot of applications also works fine without
  recompilation, if the original Xaw library is replaced with
  XawPlus.</p>

  <p>XawPlus make it possible to use XPM pixmaps in labels, toggles
  or buttons without changing the code of your application via
  setting the <i>bitmap</i> resource. A transparent background is
  provided. XawPlus also provide tooltips for buttons, toggles,
  repeaters and menu buttons without changes of the source
  code.</p>

  <p>XawPlus comes with a set of adapted applications, using also
  the new features and widgets.</p>

  <h2>2. What is different to XawPlus 3.0.1 ?</h2>

  <h4>Port to X11R6.6:</h4>

  <blockquote>
    XawPlus now based completely on the X11R6.6 sources of Xaw. All
    extensions of XawPlus are merged into these sources.
  </blockquote>

  <h4>Full UNICODE support for menu's:</h4>

  <blockquote>
    <i>SmeBSB</i> now has as <i>Label</i> full UNICODE support,
    independent of the locale settings, using <b>UTF8</b> coded
    strings.
  </blockquote>

  <h4>Selection of menu entries if <i>NumLock</i> or
  <i>CapsLock</i> is set:</h4>

  <blockquote>
    In previous versions of XawPlus menu entries are not
    highlighted and not selectible, if <i>NumLock</i> or
    <i>CapsLock</i> is activated. This bug is now fixed.

  <h2>3. Short description of the widgets</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Simple Widgets</h3>

  <p>Each of these widgets performs a specific user interface
  function. They are <i>simple</i> because they cannot have widget
  children like <i>manager</i> widgets. These widgets display
  information or take user input.</p>

      image.</td>

  <h3>3.2 Menus</h3>

  <p>The Athena Widget Set provides support for single paned
  non-hirarchical popup and pulldown menus. Since menus are such a
  common user interface tool, support for must be provided in even
  the most basic widget sets.</p>

  <p>Menus are implemented as a menu container (the SimpleMenu
  widget) and a collection of objects that comprise the menu
  entries. The SimpleMenu widget is itself a direct subclass of the
  OverrideShell widget class, so no other shell is necessary when
  creating a menu. The managed children of a SimpleMenu must be
  subclasses of the Sme (Simple Menu Entry) object.</p>

  <table cellspacing="4" cellpadding="0" width="90%" summary="">
    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top"><b><a href=
      "MenuButton.html">MenuButton</a></b></td>

      <td>A push button, that pops up an override shell containing
      the menu.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top"><b><a href=
      "SimpleMenu.html">SimpleMenu</a></b></td>

      <td>The override shell containing the menu entries. These
      entries are <i>SmeBSB</i> or <i>SmeLine</i> objects.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top"><b><a href=
      "Sme.html">Sme</a></b></td>

      <td>The base class of all menu entries. It may be used as a
      menu entry itself to provide blank space in an menu. `Sme'
      means `Simple Menu Entry'.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top"><b><a href=
      "SmeBSB.html">SmeBSB</a></b></td>

      <td>This menu entry provides a selectable entry containing a
      text string. A bitmap or a pixmap may also be placed in the
      left and right margins. BSB means `Bitmap String
      Bitmap'.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top"><b><a href=
      "SmeLine.html">SmeLine</a></b></td>

      <td>This menu entry provides an unselectable entry containing
      a separator line.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>3.3 Text Widgets</h3>

  <p>The Text widget provides a window that will allow an
  application to display and edit one or more lines of text.
  Options are provided to allow the user to add Scrollbars to its
  window, search for a specific string and modify the text in the
  buffer.</p>

  <p>The Text widget is made up of a number of pieces; it was
  modularize to ease customization. The AsciiText widget class (not
  limited to ascii but so named for compatibility) is be general
  enough to most needs. This is the widget, which is meant to
  instantiate directly from an application. If more features are
  needed as provided in AsciiText, they can be be added by creating
  a new widget, subclassing the Text widget.</p>

  <table cellspacing="4" cellpadding="0" width="90%" summary="">
    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top"><b><a href=

      It can be used as line editor or as an text editor. Since
      X11R6 this widget is able to handle simple ascii text using
      the <b><i>AsciiSource</i></b> and <b><i>AsciiSink</i></b>
      objects or multi byte coded international text using the
      <b><i>MultiSource</i></b> and <b><i>MultiSink</i></b>

  <h3>3.4 Manager Widgets</h3>

  <p>Manager widgets contains other widgets and controls the size
  and position of their location. The managed widgets can either be
  simple widgets like labels, buttons and lists or other manager
  widgets. These manager widgets differs in the way they handle the
  <i>geometry management</i> of their children. Geometry management
  means how to organize the position and possibly defined depencies
  between the childrens position in the managed area.</p>

  <table cellspacing="4" cellpadding="0" width="90%" summary="">
    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top"><b><a href="Box.html">Box
